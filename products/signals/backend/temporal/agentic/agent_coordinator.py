    The set of *candidate* skills comes from:
      - `enabled_skill_names = None` → all `signals-agent-*` skills on the team.
      - `enabled_skill_names = [list]` → the list verbatim (deduped while preserving
        order), intersected with the skills that actually exist on the team so the
        activity output is grounded in reality.

    The coordinator then samples `min(runs_per_tick, len(candidates))` distinct skills
    from the candidate set uniformly at random per tick (sampled without replacement, so
    the same skill cannot fire twice in one tick). With `runs_per_tick=1` (the default),
    each candidate gets an equal share of run slots over time without firing them all
    every tick. Higher `runs_per_tick` lets a single team cover more lenses per tick —
    useful for dogfood teams where the daily search-space matters more than per-tick
    worker compactness. New `signals-agent-foo` skills authored by users automatically
    join the rotation without coordinator-side wiring.

    Edge cases (handled in-place — no exceptions):
      - `runs_per_tick = 0` → returns `[]`. Soft-pause: the team stays `enabled=True`
        but contributes no runs this tick. Useful during incident windows without
        flipping the boolean.
      - `runs_per_tick > len(candidates)` → clamps via `min()`. A team with 2 skills
        and `runs_per_tick=10` runs both, no error.
      - `len(candidates) == 0` → returns `[]`. Same as before — nothing to sample from.

    Inefficiency on a team where a specialist is irrelevant (e.g. `signals-agent-llm-analytics`
    on a project with no LLM activity) is handled at the agent layer via memory: the
    specialist's first run writes "no LLM activity here, close out fast" and future runs
    short-circuit cold via the memory read.

    policy never collapses ticks at scale. Temporal's task queue + worker concurrency
    handles the throttling — if workers are saturated, the children just queue.

    Idempotency: child workflow IDs are deterministic per `(team_id, skill_name, tick_id)`,
